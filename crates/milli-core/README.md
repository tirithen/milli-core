# milli-core

This is a fork of  the full
[Meilisearch]: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch service, created to
provide only the core index and search functionality. This is useful for
embeding search functionality inside another rust process.

If you need the full service, instead use the full Meilisearch project.
